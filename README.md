### Football

**Team:** Leah Lukens

My final project will be using a data set I used in a previous project. It is about football, both college and pro. I am more interested in college football, specifically SEC football, so I will make the data set smaller and more manageable by focusing only on SEC players. I am interested in finding out how much money players make in the NFL, but haven't found a dataset for that topic. If I could find that dataset, I would analyze which SEC teams have players that go on to make the most money in the NFL.
